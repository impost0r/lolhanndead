Some call him Michael Dean Major, Jr.

Others know him as hann aka marcdoubt aka patton aka niggered aka roughly a
million other nicks. No matter what name you know him as, you'll know he's a
total louse and he has been a scab on the scene for months and months! He has
been expunged from every group he has attempted to brown-nose his way into
because he is a lying, self-aggrandizing, thief, know-nothing, meanie junky who
couldn't hold HTP's jockstrap (even though he did for a few months, sadly).
After being brutally destroyed in doxbin 6, our hapless hero realized that
ultimately, he couldn't keep away from the "scene" (whatever that is). He
announced to the world that he was "BACC"!

People gathered around, and then we got to watch him convulse on TinyChat,
shooting up some black tar heroin and mumbling incoherent ebonics. He's such a
classy guy~

Once Stage One of his super-ultimate plan had been completed, he launched
himself into Stage Two with a cunning rivalled only by slightly retarded
monkeys. He dropped names and licked ass, but failed to get into any groups,
mostly because nobody is enough of a silly goose to mistake schizophrenic
blogging libterally sprinkled with nicks everyone knows for actual skill.
It wasn't over, though. Hann knew the scene needed him. It needed a champion!
And so he gathered a group of super-talented scene titans! #SEVENSSSSSSS was
born; his very own crew of xbox-live skids, try-hard rappers, and swatters!

#SEVENSSSSSSS~

Little did he know that the SilverLords had been paying close attention and
with our mighty Brazilian powers combined were able to own him thrice in as
many weeks. HAhaeuheAUHEaleAHUEHAuaheauaAUAhehAh ekkekEK EKkekekeKEk

  = 2014-02-02 21:13 <~marc> 3rd time i ever set up unreal+anope

Gee, I wonder why? Let's explore...

-==========================================================-
-=== Exhibit A: vps.schoolofprivacy.eu ====================-
-==========================================================-

  <~sevens> this server is
  <~sevens> soooooooooooooooooooooooooo
  <~sevens> secure
  <~sevens> like u have no idea how hard i worked
  <~sevens> before i even
  <~sevens> made ircd a user
  <~sevens> from ground up

So, you've started the most elite hacker group in town, but you have no servers
or money to speak of, what do you do? If you have anything like the skillset of
Mister Michael Dean Major you will pucker up your lips and suck every cock in
town for a free shared shell to build your budding IRC network on.

Now that you've acquired a secure base, we need to setup our IRC network. Any
true SilverLord knows that compartmentalization is key in maintaining your
network's security. Hann knows this, so he tells everyone that they have
individualized onions (don't leak lol!), but a 12 line bash script is too much
effort so fuck it, we'll skip the implementation (none of your friends would
betray you, anyway, right?). Next step is to bind all the ports to localhost,
he skips this too, since he knows that nobody likes him enough to go through the
effort of reconfiguring their IRC clients to connect to Tor hidden services.

So, since we have the clearnet address of his box, the logical step is to start
probing services! He's got some gross web apps running, but one of these had a
cute LFD we were able to leverage to enumerate the usernames from /etc/passwd.
When we pull out our handy-dandy SSH bruteforcer we find that we have access to
3 (Golly!) different user accounts on the box. Logging into the box and running
"ps faux" reveals this fine example of stellar adminning:

  root 31833 ?     Jan16   0:03 /usr/sbin/sshd -D
  root 14338 ?     Jan17   0:02  \_ sshd: patton@pts/0  
  root 14351 pts/0 Jan17   0:00  |   \_ -bash
  ircd 14527 pts/0 Jan17   0:00  |       \_ su ircd
  ircd 14528 pts/0 Jan17   0:00  |           \_ bash	
  root 14611 pts/0 Jan17   0:00  |               \_ su patton	
  root 14612 pts/0 Jan17   0:00  |                   \_ bash	
  ircd 14701 pts/0 Jan17   0:00  |                       \_ su ircd	
  ircd 14702 pts/0 Jan17   0:00  |                           \_ bash	
  root 24417 pts/0 Jan18   0:00  |                               \_ su patton	
  root 24418 pts/0 Jan18   0:00  |                                   \_ bash

As all good admins know, leaving everyone's home directories with global read
permissions is paramount to security. Following this principle, we were able to
copy ircd.tar.gz from /home/ircd, which what do you know, has Anope databases in
it! 

Using our very own Brazillian Anope database parser we find that "nigg"'s (hann
appears to think he's black) NickServ password is "hitlist1", which also happens
to be the ircd's user account on the box! After much rejoicing, we mined all of
the logs from his bots (very ethical, Mister Dean) and proceeded to hackily hook
his IRCd. Being slightly impatient, we decided to go ahead and restart the IRCd
and see if he didn't notice. This nets us his oper hash, "datgoodgreen" (more
wigger shit).

  ~ # grep -Ei "(oper|identify)" log
  BOPM: ns identify pass123
  BOPM: OPER nigg datgoodgreen
  BOPM: JOIN #oper
  rory: JOIN #opers 
  rory: MODE #opers
  rory: MODE #opers
  rory: oper nigg datgoodgreen
  rory: PRIVMSG nickserv :identify hitlist1
  nc: JOIN #opers 
  nc: MODE #opers
  ~ # 

Unfortunately, hann was wide awake on a cocaine binge and noticed the IRCd
restart right away, but after finding us in nearly every user account on the
box despite his best attempts at expunging us (deleting /tmp/) he decided he
should reformat it. Happily for Melly, hann really enjoyed the Unreal hook:

  <pppp> but he did leave me
  <pppp> a nice
  <pppp> unreal hook
  <pppp> to steal

Thanks hann! Guess we'll share with the class:

  FILE *f = fopen("log", "a+");
  fprintf(f, "%s: %s\n", (*cptr->name ? cptr->name : "*"), cptr->buffer);
  fclose(f);

Anyone with half a brain and ten minutes could come up with something better,
but that's hann for you, he can't do any original work so he just steals
everything can find. RIP #SEVENSv1.

(._____.). Since hann couldn't handle the SilverLords, he had to concede defeat
and delete fucking everything! Of course, hann suffers from delusions of
grandeur and cannot be defeated, so to hann this is a victory against the
chatters! Everybody wins! Yaaaaaaay! :D

Michael would have us believe that only two people hate him in the whole wide
world, but he is about to find out that nobody likes him, he's just an Elly and
Melly punching bag. kekekkekkKEhAhAHhaeuEheuahUAHEhauHUAehuehuaheuUAHe

What if we were to tell you, that we did have an insider all along? Well, we
totally did. One Glorious Knight of the SilverLord Roundtable had gained trust
through disinformation, Mitnicking and juping peoples' nicks and credz. Good ol'
hacking too.

[Lord]IntangirTheGod managed to root the box with clever heckin' maneuvers and
took it to it, grabbing everything that was great off the box, including hann's
important research, which we will show in a minute. 

Then zeekill went and nulled the box before we could "tidy up the box" for him.
OH WELL kekekKEHAhleahehUAUHEuahUAEHuehehauHAh. RIP #SEVENSv2.

After hann got nulled by zee, he moved his irc to a new joint where we had onion
access too (everyone else was connecting from a znc to a clearnet IP 
pool-108-56-251-199.washdc.fios.verizon.net).

Anxious to get rid of the cretinous bottom feeder and be done with it, we made
one final play: /nick'd up as our true selves [Lord]IntangirTheGod and hit the
default kill switch "/die die-you-stupid" (fantastic administration, hann):

  =             --- | You're now known as [Lord]IntangirTheGod
  =  <~[Lord]IntangirTheGod> SHOUTS TO THE SILVERLORDS MOTHER FUCKERS
  =  <~[Lord]IntangirTheGod> SHOUTS TO ELLYEL8 AND MELLYEL8
  =  <~[Lord]IntangirTheGod> In 2013, hann started telling close friends that he's been infected with [[GRIDS]] ever since the first   time he tried heroin. Once this story inevitably spread, he changed his story by saying that he lied about having AIDS in order to gain sympathy and pandhandle money from these friends, because he's a shameless junkie piece of shit. It was originally proposed as a thought experiment that much like Schrodinger's Cat, hann could be thought to both be HIV positive and negative at the same time. It was later determined by a panel of duly elected dramacrats that actual infection by a retrovirus is irrelevant in hann's case - he has AIDS.

  <--	z ([email protected]) has quit (Leaving...)
  wind	In 2013, hann started telling close friends that he's been infected with [[GRIDS]] ever since the first time he  tried heroin. Once this story inevitably spread, he changed his story by saying that he lied about having AIDS in order to gain sympathy and pandhandle money from these friends, because he's a shameless junkie piece of shit. It was originally proposed as a thought experiment that much   like
  wind	Schrodinger's Cat, hann could be thought to both be HIV positive and negative at the same time. It was later determined by a panel of duly elected dramacrats that actual infection by a retrovirus is irrelevant in hann's case - he has AIDS.
  --	[z] is away: Offline
  wind	LOOOOOOOOOOOOL
